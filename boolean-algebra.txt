/**************** BOOLEAN LAWS | BOOLEAN ALGEBRA ***************/

1. Commutative law: Any binary operation which satisfies the following expression is referred to as commutative operation.
    i. A.B = B.A
    ii. A + B = B + A
    Commutative law states that changing the sequence of variables does not have any effect on the output of a logic value.
    
2. Associative law: This law states that the order in which the logic operations are performed is irrelevant as their effect is the same.
    i. (A.B).C = A.(B.C)
    ii. (A+B)+C = A+(B+C)
    
3. Distributive law
    i. A.(B+C)=A.B+A.C

4. AND law: Following laws use the AND operation. Therefore they're called as AND laws.
    i. A.0 = 0
    ii. A.1 = A
    iii. A.A = A
    iv. A.(!A) = = 0
    
5. OR law: Following las uses the NOT operation. Therefore they're called as OR laws.
    i. A + 0 = A
    ii. A + 1 = 1
    iii. A + A = A
    iv. A + !A = 1
    
6. INVERSION law: This law uses the NOT operation. The inversion law states that double inversion of a variable results in the original
    variable itself.
    i. !!A = A
    
7. De Morgan's Theorem: De Morgan has suggested two theorems which are extremely useful in Boolean Algebra. The two theorems are discussed below.
    i. !(A.B) = !A + !B 
      NAND = Bubbled OR
      
    ii. !(A+B) = (!A).(!B)
        NOR = Bubbled AND
