What you can do with the File API:
  1. Perform client-side file operations, such as limiting the size of uploads.
  2. Restricts the kinds of files that can be uploaded to a server.
  3. Generate thumbnail versions of images that are being uploaded.
  4. Check to see if the modification date of a local file is before or after a certain date.
  5. Parse the content of files locally to get detailed information. (e.g Spell check for a text file)
  6. Modify file contents before they are sent off to the server.
